The Drink Reminder System is a simple yet effective web-based application designed to remind users to drink water at regular intervals. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project promotes healthy hydration habits, especially for individuals who spend long hours at desks or in front of screens.

The application runs directly in the browser and uses JavaScript timers and notifications to alert users periodically. Users can customize the reminder frequency and receive gentle sound or visual cues to take a sip of water.# Drink-Reminder-System
